# MaxHeap
create a Max-heap from at least 100 integers using both sequential and optimal methods of insertion , and test software using (1) 20 sets of 100 randomly generated  integers to build 20 heaps and find average number of swaps for both methods, and (2) with fixed integers 1 - 100, printing first 10, the average number of swaps for both  optimal and insertion methods, and then perform 10 removal operations and output first 10 in order again. Program will print to console and to output.txt located in EricSchenck2.zip
